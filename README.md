### Author: Andrii Zhurba
The relevant project is located in src directory, TravelInsurancePrediction.ipynb file.

This project aims to develop and refine a 
predictive model that predicts the outcome of a 
customer buying a travel insurance or not.
The goal is to accurately predict the target variable 
based on various features in the dataset and provide 
actionable insights for business decision-making. 

## Dataset
* Size: Approximately 2000 rows
* Features: The dataset includes 8 features(5 binary and 3 numeric).
* Data Cleaning: Duplicated entries have been identified and removed to ensure the integrity of the data. Details on these removals are provided in the analysis section.

## Objectives
* Model Development: Evaluate and develop machine 
model which is the best at predicting whether the
customer will buy travel insurance or not.
* Feature Analysis: Analyze the importance of 
various features to understand their impact on the 
model
* Performance Optimization: Fine-tune the model 
by adjusting hyperparameters and using Ensemble learning.
